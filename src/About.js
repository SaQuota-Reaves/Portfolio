                My name is SaQuota. I am a Full Stack Developer, Educator,
                Entrepreneur, Mentor and Author. I live in Upstate, NY. I want
                to blend my love for teaching with my coding skills. My goal is
                to show kids in the urban community that I grew up in that they
                can take this route into the workforce verses the traditional
                college route. I hope that by planting theses seeds in my
                students while they are young can help them figure out what
                career they see them selves doing upon graduation.{" "}
